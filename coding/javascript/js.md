# .js notes

## Hello world perspective

javascript is quite crazy and absolutely phenomenal.

I take the challenge to be challenged and changed by the programmers's nightmare JAVASCRIPT.

The idea is to bow down to this language and love it.

***I can't say my name when I'm with you [javascript] but I love it :)***
